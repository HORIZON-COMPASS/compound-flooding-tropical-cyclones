The structure of the folder is as follows:
- Workflows
    - Config - per model  : Model configuration files
    - Config_snakemake : Snakemake configuration files
    - data_catalogs : The data catalogs used for model building and used by HydroMT
    - scripts
        - model_building : Scripts used to build the models
        - preprocessing : Scripts used for preprocessing of data, updating models etc.
        - postprocessing : Scripts used for postprocessing of model results


## **Workflows**

Four snakemake workflow files are present. All workflows work both on Linux as well as on Windows. All snakemake workflows use the same config yml file: config_snakemake/config_general.yml. 

- [Workflows](#workflows)
  - [snakefile_all.smk](#snakefile_allsmk): This workflow combines all other snakemake workflows into one large workflow. The sequence of the workflows are: snakefile_sfincs_build.smk > snakefile_wflow.smk > snakefile_sfincs_update.smk
  - [snakefile_sfincs_build.smk](#snakefile_sfincs_buildsmk): This workflow builds a SFINCS model without adding any forcing yet. The workflow consists of just one rule.
  - [snakefile_wflow.smk](#snakefile_wflowsmk): This workflow builds a wflow model, using the SFINCS region as input. Gauges are added on the SFINCS inflow points, in order to generate output at the correct locations. Precipitation forcing is added based on the event start and end time. First, the wflow model is warmed up for a period of 1 year, with daily ERA5 data. The event itself is run with the forcing data as given in the snakemake configuration file.
  - [snakefile_sfincs_update](#snakefile_sfincs_updatesmk): This workflow updates the SFINCS model by adding forcing data and running the model simulations. It handles the addition of both meteorological and WFlow forcing data, executes the model, and generates the output.
   - [snakefile_dfm.smk](#snakefile_dfmsmk):This workflow creates a dfm base model and updates it by adding forcing data and running the model simulations. It also add the output to a data catalog which can be used as SFINCS waterlevel forcing.

In the section below, the different workflows are described:

### Workflow --- snakefile_all.smk ---
This workflow combines all other snakemake workflows into one large workflow. The sequence of the workflows are: 

snakefile_sfincs_build.smk > snakefile_wflow.smk > snakefile_sfincs_update.smk

### Workflow --- snakefile_sfincs_build.smk ---

This workflow builds a SFINCS model without adding any forcing yet. The workflow consists of just one rule.

#### Rule: make_base_model_sfincs
- **Script**: `scripts/model_building/sfincs/setup_sfincs_base.py`
- **Input**: `config_sfincs/sfincs_base_build.yml`
- **Output**: SFINCS model for the region (bounding box defined in `config_snakemake/config_general.yml`).
- **Description**: This rule creates the SFINCS model  using the bbox given in the snakemakeThe model domain is based on the bounding box as given in the config_snakemake/config_general.yml file.
Further options for building the model are given in the *config_sfincs\sfincs_base_build.yml* input file.
The bounding box is then  used to find all intersecting subbasins (hydroAtlas level 12). These intersecting subbasins form the model region. Also, the model region extents to the -5???m contour line. 


### Workflow --- snakefile_wflow.smk ---

This workflow builds a wflow model, using the SFINCS region as input. Gauges are added on the SFINCS inflow points, in order to generate output at the correct locations. Precipitation forcing is added based on the event start and end time. First, the model is warmed up for a period of 1 year, with daily ERA5 data. The event itself is run with the forcing data as given in the snakemake config file.
